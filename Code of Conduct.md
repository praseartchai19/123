**OCP Code of Conduct**

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by OCP. This includes our website, the Wiki pages, OCP Github, the mailing lists, the project community calls, workshops, webinars or events, social media communities, and any other forums created by the Foundation or Project Leadership which the community uses for communication and exchange of information. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

If a participant believes someone is violating the code of conduct, The Foundation ask that it be reported immediately by emailing conduct@opencomputeproject.org.

 - **All participants must be friendly and patient.**
 
 - **All participants must be welcoming**. The OCP Community strives to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
 
 - **All participants must be considerate.** The work will be used by other people, and the work in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision that is made will affect users and colleagues, and participants should take those consequences into account when making decisions. This is a world-wide community, so communication might not be done in someone else's primary language.
 
 - **All participants must be respectful.** Not everyone will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Participants of the OCP Community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the OCP Community.
 
 - **All participants must be careful in the words that they choose.** This is a community of professionals, and professional conduct is key to success. Insults or shaming of other participants, harassment and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
	 - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
	 - Discriminatory jokes and language.
	 - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
	 - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally  identifying information ("doxing").
	 - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
	 - Unwelcome sexual attention.
	 - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
	 - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
 - **Disagreements are the perfect opportunity for growth and learning lessons.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and the OCP Community is no exception. It is important that disagreements are resolved constructively and differing views are shared professionally. The strength of OCP comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues.
